        <h2 class="home-headline-1">Welcome to Study Smarter!</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-1">Here you can learn everything about how to study on a smarter way. To study smarter you need to understand about the learning, retention and masterization processes. Study Smarter will help you to learn tips and tricks to maximize the outcomes from your studies. You may be asking yourself, why should I study about how to study? Well, there are many reasons to do so!</p>

        <p class="home-paragraph-2">First: by undersanding how to study you will be able to learn more information from your studies, keep more information and be able to reacess such information easily. By doing so, you will not need to study harder are doing to get better results, you only need to study smarter. </p>
        <p class="home-paragraph-3">Second: by studying smarter, you are going to get better results. It has been scientifically comproved that students who have better study methods achieve more than students who only study for longer hours. When I was a high school student, I constantly struggled with the feeling of needing to study more, so I constantly sacrified all other things for the sake of getting better grades. However, because I learned how to study better, now I can get even superior results AND studying for less time. </p>
      <p class="home-paragraph-4">Third: studying smarter will help you retain what you've studied. It is easy to forget. Every time I was learning a new language, it wasn't easy to memorize all the new words to use them on conversations. By learning the words and using them repeatedly I was able to really learn them. Doesn't the same apply to all the other kinds of knowledge? I know that you also forgot that important math formula during a test. So, how do we remember things that we studied weeks, months or even years ago? The answer is simple! By studying smarter. </p>
