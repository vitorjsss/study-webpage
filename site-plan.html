      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/050533-ffffff-f0faf9-013a20" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/050533-ffffff-f0faf9-013a20</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#050533]</td><td class="secondary">[#FFFFFF]</td><td class="accent1">[#F0FAF9]</td><td class="accent2">[#013A20]</td></tr>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Montserrat  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
Montserrat is a font that looks modern and elegant, which is perfect for the website purpose as it will focus on both young people and families. This font is also easily readable and is a perfect match for headings.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Sanchez  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
I choose this font as it combines with Montserrat in a great way. It is distinct to Montserrat, it is a bit more formal which is appropriate for a study website. I also chose to use this font because it is a serif font. There is an evident contrast between them.
      </p>

        It is not important to sudy hard but to study smart. Studying smarter is the best way to achieve better results from your studies. Welcome to Study Smarter! Here you can learn everything about how to study on a smarter way. To study smarter you need to understand about the learning, retention and masterization processes. Study Smarter will help you to learn tips and tricks to maximize the outcomes from your studies. You may be asking yourself, why should I study about how to study? Well, there are many reasons to do so!
        First: by undersanding how to study you will be able to learn more information from your studies, keep more information and be able to reacess such information easily. By doing so, you will not need to study harder are doing to get better results, you only need to study smarter.
        Second: by studying smarter, you are going to get better results. It has been scientifically comproved that students who have better study methods achieve more than students who only study for longer hours. When I was a high school student, I constantly struggled with the feeling of needing to study more, so I constantly sacrified all other things for the sake of getting better grades. However, because I learned how to study better, now I can get even superior results AND studying for less time.
        Third: studying smarter will help you retain what you've studied. It is easy to forget. Every time I was learning a new language, it wasn't easy to memorize all the new words to use them on conversations. By learning the words and using them repeatedly I was able to really learn them. Doesn't the same apply to all the other kinds of knowledge? I know that you also forgot that important math formula during a test. So, how do we remember things that we studied weeks, months or even years ago? The answer is simple! By studying smarter.
